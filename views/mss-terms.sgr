    h2 MANAGED SERVICES SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS

    p THESE MANAGED SERVICES TERMS (“Managed Services Terms”) shall apply with respect to all “Managed Services” (as defined herein) provided by Horsetail to or on behalf of Client as stated on the Statement of Services as signed by and between the Parties (“SoS”), as the same may be modified from time to time by the Parties in writing.

    p
      span Managed Services:
      |  During the Term, Horsetail will provide to Client all of the managed information technology related services (“Managed Services”) as listed on the Statement of Services attached to the Master Services Agreement between Horsetail and Client (“SoS”), as the same may be revised from time to time by the written agreement of the Parties, for the fees as set forth on the SoS (subject to annual rate changes as may be indicated in a written notice delivered to Client within sixty days prior to the effective date of the rate change). If Client requires additional computer or network support services which are outside the scope of the Managed Services as identified on the SoS, Horsetail will provide Client with a price quotation for such additional services. Horsetail will not be obligated to perform any such additional Managed Services unless Client agrees in writing to the scope/price quotation.

    p
      span Managed Services Term:
      |  Unless otherwise stated herein or in the SoS, the term for the Managed Services (“Managed Services Term”) shall commence upon the execution of the SoS and be for an initial term of one (1) year, whereupon these Managed Services Terms shall automatically renew every year unless within thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the then current term, either Party provides written notice to the other Party that it does not intend to renew the Managed Services Term.

    p
      span Managed Services Fees and Payment:
      |  During the Managed Services Term, Client shall pay Horsetail monthly in advance, the managed services fee(s) as stated on the SOS (whether singular or plural, the “Managed Services Fees”), on or before the first day of each month for the Managed Services. Client may pay the monthly Managed Services Fees by check or credit card (Visa, MasterCard, or American Express). Late payments shall incur interest at the maximum legal rate, or at the rate of 1.5% per month if there is no maximum legal rate. Horsetail may collect attorney’s fees equal to fifteen percent (15%) of any balance due if Client’s account is turned over to an attorney for collection, whether or not suit is filed. Managed Service Fees are based on Client’s employee count and such fees shall be modified as Client’s employee count changes. Client’s employee count will be audited quarterly. Client must produce its federal 941 tax statements or other acceptable quarterly employee list so that Horsetail can perform its audit of Client’s current employee count. Fees for Managed Services will be adjusted at time of audit to compensate for any change. Horsetail will charge Client for requested Managed Services in accordance with the following Rate Schedule:

    p
      span Expenses:

Where possible, all Expenses will be charged directly to the Client. The Retainer Fees shall be exclusive of disbursements and expenses, which shall include following specific items and any additional items approved in writing by Client (“Expenses”), which shall be charged and invoiced at cost together with a 10% handling charge: travel (and related lodging and food charges), courier and postage charges. If Client requests Horsetail to purchase goods or commission services from a third party where the cost is likely to be substantial, Horsetail will be entitled to require that all or some of that third party expense is paid in advance by Client before confirming the purchase or commission. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement: (1) Client may not incur more than $10,000 in Expenses hereunder in any calendar month during the Retainer Services Term without obtaining the prior written consent of Client; (2) invoices for any Expenses shall be accompanied by itemized statements showing each Expense incurred hereunder and supported by bona fide receipts for each such Expense; and (3) Horsetail shall comply with any written travel and expense reimbursement guidelines and procedures provided to it by Client, to the extent they do not expressly violate any provision hereof.

      span Standard Business Hours:
      |  Horsetail’s standard hours for Managed Services are Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. (Eastern) (except Federal holidays). If Horsetail performs any Managed Services for Client at other times (such as nights or weekends) that are outside the scope of SOS, Client will be billed at a one (1) hour minimum at the rate of $200 per hour. If Horsetail performs Services for Client on Federal holidays, Client shall pay to Horsetail $200 per hour for the same. Although it will make every effort to do so if needed by the Client, Horsetail cannot guarantee that it will be available to perform Managed Services on nights, weekends or holidays.
